# print() that is the type of function
# assignment â†’ storing variable



def greeting(name, department):

# Output:
# Welcome, Blake
# You are part of IT Support

# Output
# The sum of both areas is: 20.5

# 1) Complete the function to return the result of the conversion
def convert_distance(miles):
	km = miles * 1.6  # approximately 1.6 km in 1 mile
	return km

# 2) Convert my_trip_miles to kilometers by calling the function above
my_trip_km = convert_distance(my_trip_miles)

# 3) Fill in the blank to print the result of the conversion
print("The distance in kilometers is " + str(my_trip_km))

# 4) Calculate the round-trip in kilometers by doubling the result,
#    and fill in the blank to print the result
print("The round-trip in kilometers is " + str(2.0*my_trip_km))

# Output:
# The distance in kilometers is 88.0
# The round-trip in kilometers is 176.0


# This function compares two numbers and returns them
# in increasing order.

# Output:

# SUBCHAPTER CONDITIONALS

# boolean = one of two possible states: true or false


#interesting because the output is true
print("Yellow" > "Cyan")

# Output:
# True

# not operator can make boolean yang menghasilkan false jadi true, atau sebalinya

print(not 42 == "Answer")

# Output:
# True

# To check if two values are the same, we can use the equality operator: == 
# To check if two values are not the same, we can use the not equals operator: != 

# he ability of a program to alter its execution sequence is called branching

# today i learn about if else, ez

# you can use elif too, so that code isn't too long
